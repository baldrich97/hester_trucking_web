X On cusotmer select, query unpaid from that customer and display with select boxes, remember to filter by consolidated = null to not double dip
X On create, make a new invoice with the total of the summed selected and set consolidated to the pkey of them to the new pkey
X Consolidated tab shows all already consolidated invoices, grouped like loads where they can expand and see all the ones included
X Add consolidated to db and to the unpaid invoices table so they can see which ones are already conslidated
X When a consolidated invoice is paid, flag all child invoices as paid
X If they delete one just set consolidated to null on the affected ones
X In super invoice print query all invoices with that consolidated
X In super invoice display show the breakdown like loads where they can see each one in it
X Add consolidated to the [ID] view as well as another checkbox
X Need to refresh unpaid data

X Need to separate out the api calls for the customer get and the unpaid data get
X Need to somehow show that the parent invoice is a consolidated one while also showing the children as consolidated too
	probably just add new column called isConsolidated? that way on [ID] get if isConsolidated I can trigger different logic, and I can display differently on the table
Need to add in the ability to do custom cols to the table, there have been too many times I've needed to just do a one-off column

added consolidated
added conslidatedID
updated things to default to 0
changed dates in invoices to be datetimes
changes dates in loads to be datetimes
probably should do that in others too


Prefill data
Fix old invoices/loads
X Super invoice
X Create location/type on create if not there
If load edited update invoice?
